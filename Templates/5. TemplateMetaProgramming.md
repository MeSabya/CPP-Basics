## Template MetaProgramming

```cpp
// templateFactorial.cpp

#include <iostream>

template <int N> 
struct Factorial{
    static int const value = N * Factorial<N-1>::value;
};

template <> 
struct Factorial<1>{
    static int const value = 1;
};

int main(){
    std::cout << Factorial<10>::value << std::endl;
}
```
The Factorial function calls itself recursively by storing the result of each iteration in value. For the base case, the result is multiplied by 1 in line 12 and the answer is stored in value.

To be precise, what looks like a recursion, like in the case of Factorial, is not a recursion. 
Each invocation of Factorial<N> triggers a new instantiation Factorial<N-1> in line  ```static int const value = N * Factorial<N-1>::value;```



Let us take a closer look at the original program. When compiler sees Factorial<10>::value, 
it tries to create an instance of Factorial with parameter as 10, it turns out that Factorial<9> must also be created and static int constant val must be evaluated at 
compile time. For Factoial<8>, compiler need Factorial<7> and so on. 
Finally, compiler uses Factorial<1>::val and compile time recursion terminates. So, using templates, we can write programs that do computation at compile time, 
such programs are called **template metaprograms.** 

Template metaprogramming is in fact Turing-complete, meaning that any computation expressible by a computer program can be computed, in some form, 
by a template metaprogram. Template Metaprogramming is generally not used in practical programs, it is an interesting concept though.
