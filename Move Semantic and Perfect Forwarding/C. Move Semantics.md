# Move Semantics
We will talk about properties of the move semantic in this lesson that are not mentioned as often.

Containers of the STL can have non-movable elements. The copy semantic is the fallback for the move semantic.

Letâ€™s learn more about the move semantic.

## std::move
The function std::move moves its resource.

Needs the header ```<utility>```

Converts the type of its argument into a rvalue reference.

The compiler applies the move semantic to the rvalue reference.

It is a static_cast to a rvalue reference under the hood.

```cpp
static_cast<std::remove_reference<decltype(arg)>::type&&>(arg);
```
 
What is happening here?

- decltype(arg): deduces the type of the argument.
- std::remove_reference<....> removes all references from the type of the argument.
- static_cast<....>&& adds two references to the type.
 
Copy semantic is a fallback for move semantic. This means if we invoke std::move with a non-moveable type, copy-semantic is used because an rvalue can be bound to an rvalue reference and a constant lvalue reference.

## STL#
Each container of the STL and std::string gets two new methods:

Move constructor
Move assignment operator
These new methods get their arguments as non-constant rvalue references.

### Example#
vector{
  vector(vector&& vec);                   //move constructor
  vector& operator = (vector&& vec);      //move assignment
  vector(const vector& vec);              //copy constructor
  vector& operator = (const vector& vec); // copy assignment
}
The classical copy constructor and copy assignment operator get their argument as a constant lvalue reference.

## User-defined data types#
User-defined data types can support move and copy semantics as well.

### Example#
class MyData{
  MyData(MyData&& m) = default;
  MyData& operator = (MyData&& m) = default; 
  MyData(const MyData& m) = default;
  MyData& operator = (const myData& m) = default;
};
The move semantic has priority over the copy semantic.

## Strategy of the move constructor#
- Set the attributes of the new object.
- Move the content of the old object.
- Set the old object in a valid state.
- The move constructor and the other big five#
- The move constructor is created automatically if all attributes of the class and all base classes also have one move constructor.

### This rule holds for the big six:

  Default constructor
  Destructor
  Move and copy constructor
  Move and copy assignment operator
