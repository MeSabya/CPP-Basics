Structured bindings are a C++17 feature that allows you to bind multiple variables to the elements of a structured object, such as a tuple or struct or map, in a single declaration.

For example:

```cpp
std::pair a(0, 1.0f);
auto [x, y] = a;
```

x binds to int stored in the generated object that is a copy of a. And similarly, y binds to float.
