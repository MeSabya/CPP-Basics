## Difference between std::lock_guard and std::unique_lock in C++

### The characteristics of std::lock_guard are:

It holds the lock from the time of construction until the time of destruction.
When it is created, it tries to take control of the mutex which contains resources, it is provided. When this control is over, the std::lock_guard will destroy and mutex frees.
It is defined under the header file mutex.h.


#### Syntax:

```cpp
template < class Mutex > //Mutex is the resource to lock
class Std_lock_guard;
```

### The characteristics of std::unique_lock are:

It does not lock as soon as it is created and unlocks at any time within the time it exists.
It is similar to std::lock_guard but provides many methods for locking, unlocking and removing locks.
This transfers lock ownership from one instance of the resource to another.
It is defined under the header file mutex.h.

#### Syntax:

```cpp
template < class Mutex > //Mutex is the resource to lock
class Std_unique_lock;
```
