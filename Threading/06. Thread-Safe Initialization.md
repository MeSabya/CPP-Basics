## Thread-Safe Initialization

There are three ways in C++ to initialize variables in a thread-safe way.

- Constant expressions.
- The function std::call_once in combination with the flag std::once_flag.
- A static variable with block scope.
- The easiest and fourth way to initialise a variable in a thread-safe way: initialise the variable in the main-thread before you create any child threads.

### Thread-Safe Initialization: Constant Expressions

Constant expressions are expressions that the compiler can evaluate at compile time; they are implicitly thread-safe. Placing the keyword constexpr in front of a variable makes the variable a constant expression. The constant expression must be initialized immediately.

```cpp
constexpr double pi = 3.14;
```

Additionally, user-defined types can also be constant expressions. For those types, there are a few restrictions that must be met in order to initialize it at compile time.

- They must not have virtual methods or a virtual base class.
- Their constructor must be empty and itself be a constant expression.
- Their methods, which should be callable at compile time, must be constant expressions.

Instances of MyDouble satisfy all these requirements, so it is possible to instantiate them at compile time. This instantiation is thread-safe.

```cpp
// constexpr.cpp

#include <iostream>

class MyDouble{
  private:
    double myVal1;
    double myVal2;
  public:
    constexpr MyDouble(double v1,double v2):myVal1(v1),myVal2(v2){}
    constexpr double getSum() const { return myVal1 + myVal2; }
};

int main() {

  constexpr double myStatVal = 2.0;
  constexpr MyDouble myStatic(10.5, myStatVal);
  constexpr double sumStat= myStatic.getSum();
  std::cout << "SumStat: "<<sumStat << std::endl;
}
```

### Thread-Safe Initialization: call_once and once_flag

By using the std::call_once function you can register a callable. The std::once_flag ensures that only one registered function will be invoked, but you can register additional functions via the same std::once_flag. That being said, only one function from that group is called.

The famous singleton pattern guarantees that only one instance of an object will be created. This is a challenging task in multithreading environments, but std::call_once and std::once_flag make the job a piece of cake. Now the singleton is initialized in a thread-safe way.

```cpp
// singletonCallOnce.cpp

#include <iostream>
#include <mutex>

using namespace std;

class MySingleton{

  private:
    static once_flag initInstanceFlag;
    static MySingleton* instance;
    MySingleton() = default;
    ~MySingleton() = default;

  public:
    MySingleton(const MySingleton&) = delete;
    MySingleton& operator=(const MySingleton&) = delete;

    static MySingleton* getInstance(){
      call_once(initInstanceFlag,MySingleton::initSingleton);
      return instance;
    }

    static void initSingleton(){
      instance= new MySingleton();
    }
};

MySingleton* MySingleton::instance = nullptr;
once_flag MySingleton::initInstanceFlag;

int main(){

  cout << endl;

  cout << "MySingleton::getInstance(): "<< MySingleton::getInstance() << endl;
  cout << "MySingleton::getInstance(): "<< MySingleton::getInstance() << endl;

  cout << endl;

}
```

### Thread-Safe Initialization - Static Variables with Block Scope

Static variables with block scope will be created exactly once and lazily (i.e. created just at the moment of the usage). This characteristic is the basis of the so-called Meyers Singleton, named after Scott Meyers. This is by far the most elegant implementation of the singleton pattern.

```cpp
// meyersSingleton.cpp

class MySingleton{
public:
  static MySingleton& getInstance(){
    static MySingleton instance;
    return instance;
  }
private:
  MySingleton();
  ~MySingleton();
  MySingleton(const MySingleton&)= delete;
  MySingleton& operator=(const MySingleton&)= delete;

};

MySingleton::MySingleton()= default;
MySingleton::~MySingleton()= default;

int main(){

  MySingleton::getInstance();

}
```
